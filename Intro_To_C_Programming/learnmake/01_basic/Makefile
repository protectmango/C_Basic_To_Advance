# LEVEL 1: Most Basic Makefile
# This is the simplest possible Makefile
# It has only one rule to compile a single C file

# Target: what to build
# Prerequisites: what files are needed
# Recipe: commands to execute (MUST start with TAB)

hello: hello.c
	gcc hello.c -o hello

# To use this Makefile:
# 1. Run 'make' or 'make hello' to compile
# 2. Run './hello' to execute the program
# 3. Run 'make clean' (after adding clean target) to remove files
