## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Node Structure
```c
typedef struct Node {
    int data;           // 4 bytes - the actual data
    struct Node* next;  // 8 bytes - pointer to next node  
    int node_id;        // 4 bytes - unique identifier
} Node;                 // Total: 24 bytes (with padding)
```

## üîç Deep Dive Features

### Memory Layout Analysis
```
üì¶ Node 1 (ID: 1):
   Base Address: 0x7f8b4b405e80
   Data field:   0x7f8b4b405e80 (offset +0, value: 42)
   Next field:   0x7f8b4b405e88 (offset +8, value: 0x7f8b4b405ea0)
   Node size:    24 bytes
   Gap to next:  32 bytes
```

### Frame-by-Frame Animation
The program shows each step of insertion:
1. Current list state
2. New node creation in memory
3. Pointer linking process
4. Head pointer update
5. Final result
