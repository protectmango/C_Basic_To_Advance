# C File I/O Operations

This README provides a concise overview of standard file input/output (I/O) operations in C, focusing on text and binary file handling.

## The FILE Type

In C, file operations are managed using the `FILE` type, which is a typedef name for a predefined structure, typically `struct _IO_FILE`. You'll find its definition in headers like `libio.h` (often located at `/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/libio.h` on Linux systems).

When you open a file using `fopen()`:

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Memory is allocated on the heap for a `_IO_FILE` structure.
- **OS Communication**: The program interacts with the operating system's file manager to allocate a temporary buffer in RAM for file operations.
- **Success**: Returns a pointer to the allocated `FILE` structure (the base address).
- **Failure**: Returns `NULL`.

**Example**:
```c
FILE *filepointer = fopen("filename.txt", "r+");
```

## Core File Functions

Here's a breakdown of essential `FILE` functions:

### `fopen(const char *filepath, const char *mode)`
- **Purpose**: Opens a file.
- **Success**: Returns a `FILE*` pointer.
- **Failure**: Returns `NULL`.

### `fclose(FILE *filepointer)`
- **Purpose**: Closes an open file.
- **Success**: Returns `0`.
- **Failure**: Returns `EOF` or `-1`.

### `fgetc(FILE *filepointer)`
- **Purpose**: Reads a single character from the file.
- **Success**: Returns the ASCII value of the character.
- **Failure**: Returns `EOF` or `-1`.

### `fputc(int character, FILE *filepointer)`
- **Purpose**: Writes a single character to the file.
- **Success**: Returns the ASCII value of the character written.
- **Failure**: Returns `EOF` or `-1`.

### `fgets(char *string, int size, FILE *filepointer)`
- **Purpose**: Reads a line (or up to `size - 1` characters) from the file into `string`.
- **Success**: Returns the string.
- **Failure**: Returns `NULL`.

### `fputs(const char *string, FILE *filepointer)`
- **Purpose**: Writes a null-terminated string to the file.
- **Success**: Returns a non-negative number.
- **Failure**: Returns `EOF` or `-1`.

### `fprintf(FILE *filepointer, const char *format, ...)`
- **Purpose**: Writes formatted output to the file. Similar to `printf`, but writes to a file.
- **Success**: Returns the number of characters written.
- **Failure**: Returns a negative value.

### `fscanf(FILE *filepointer, const char *format, ...)`
- **Purpose**: Reads formatted input from the file. Similar to `scanf`, but reads from a file.
- **Success**: Returns the number of input items successfully matched and assigned.
- **Failure**: Returns `EOF`.

### `rewind(FILE *filepointer)`
- **Purpose**: Sets the file position indicator to the beginning of the given file stream.
- **Return**: Nothing.

## Binary File Functions

For handling binary data, use these functions:

### `size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream)`
- **Purpose**: Reads `count` items, each of `size` bytes, from the stream into the memory block pointed to by `ptr`.
- **Success**: Returns the number of items successfully read.
- **Failure**: Returns `0`.

### `size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream)`
- **Purpose**: Writes `count` items, each of `size` bytes, from the memory block pointed to by `ptr` to the stream.
- **Success**: Returns the number of items successfully written.
- **Failure**: Returns `0`.

## File Pointer Navigation

These functions allow you to control the file's read/write position:

### `long ftell(FILE *stream)`
- **Prototype**: `long ftell(FILE *stream);`
- **Purpose**: Returns the current file position indicator.
- **Success**: Returns the current offset in bytes from the beginning of the file.
- **Failure**: Returns `EOF`.

### `int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int origin)`
- **Prototype**: `int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int origin);`
- **Purpose**: Sets the file position indicator for the stream.
- **Success**: Returns `0`.
- **Failure**: Returns `EOF`.

**`origin` values**:
- `SEEK_SET` (0): Seek from the beginning of the file.
  - **Example**: `fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_SET);` (Go to the beginning)
- `SEEK_CUR` (1): Seek from the current position.
  - **Example**: `fseek(fp, 10, SEEK_CUR);` (Move 10 bytes forward from current)
- `SEEK_END` (2): Seek from the end of the file.
  - **Example**: `fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END);` (Go to the end)
```
