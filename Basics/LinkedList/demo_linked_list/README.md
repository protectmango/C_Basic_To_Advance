- **Insert at End**: Add nodes at the end of the list
- **Delete Node**: Remove nodes by value
- **Search Element**: Find elements and track comparisons
- **Reverse List**: Reverse the entire linked list
- **Display List**: Show complete list structure

### Memory Analysis Tools
- **Memory Layout Analysis**: Shows exact memory addresses and offsets
- **Stack vs Heap Demonstration**: Compare stack and heap memory allocation
- **Pointer Relationships**: Visualize how pointers connect nodes
- **Memory Tracking**: Track total memory allocated and freed

### Educational Features
- **Frame-by-Frame Animation**: Step-by-step insertion visualization
- **Detailed Memory Information**: Shows addresses, sizes, and layouts
- **Color-coded Output**: Enhanced readability with ANSI colors
- **Operation Counters**: Track number of operations performed
- **Node IDs**: Unique identifiers for each node

## 🏗️ Program Structure

### Node Structure
```c
typedef struct Node {
    int data;           // Data stored in the node
    struct Node* next;  // Pointer to the next node
    int node_id;        // Unique identifier for tracking
} Node;
```

### Key Functions

#### Memory Management
- `create_node()`: Allocates memory and initializes a new node
- `cleanup_list()`: Frees all allocated memory

#### List Operations
- `insert_at_beginning()`: Inserts node at the start
- `insert_at_end()`: Inserts node at the end
- `delete_node()`: Removes node by value
- `search_element()`: Searches for an element
- `reverse_list()`: Reverses the list

#### Analysis Functions
- `display_memory_layout()`: Shows memory structure
- `show_pointer_relationships()`: Displays pointer connections
- `demonstrate_stack_vs_heap()`: Compares memory types
- `show_frame_by_frame_insertion()`: Animated insertion

- Interactive program design

## 🔍 Detailed Features

### Memory Layout Analysis
Shows:
- Base address of each node
- Offset of data and next fields
- Size of each component
- Memory gaps between nodes

### Frame-by-Frame Animation
Demonstrates insertion process:
1. Current list state
2. New node creation
3. Pointer linking
4. Head pointer update

### Pointer Relationships
Displays:
- Head pointer analysis
- Node-to-node connections
- Memory distances between nodes
- NULL pointer handling

### Stack vs Heap Comparison
Shows differences in:
- Memory addresses
- Access speed
- Allocation/deallocation
- Storage duration

## 🧪 Testing and Debugging

### Memory Checking
If you have Valgrind installed:
```bash
make memcheck
```

### Debug Build
For detailed debugging:
```bash
make debug
```

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Empty List Operations**: Test on empty list
2. **Single Node Operations**: Test with one node
3. **Multiple Insertions**: Test various insertion patterns
4. **Deletion Edge Cases**: Delete head, tail, middle nodes
5. **Memory Stress Test**: Create and delete many nodes

## 📊 Sample Output

### Node Creation
```
🔧 CREATING NEW NODE
📊 Requesting memory from heap...
✅ Memory allocated successfully!
📍 Node address: 0x7f8b4b405e80
📏 Node size: 16 bytes
🆔 Node ID: 1
📦 Data stored: 42
🔗 Next pointer: 0x0 (NULL initially)
```

### Memory Layout
```
📦 Node 1 (ID: 1):
   Base Address: 0x7f8b4b405e80
   Data field:   0x7f8b4b405e80 (offset +0, value: 42)
   Next field:   0x7f8b4b405e88 (offset +8, value: 0x7f8b4b405ea0)
   Node size:    16 bytes
```
